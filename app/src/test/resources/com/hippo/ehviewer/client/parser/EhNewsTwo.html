                               target="_blank">A new search engine has been deployed</a>. Updates
                            and discussion related to this go in that thread.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-09-26</b><br/><br/>-
                            Three new image servers have been deployed to a secondary location,
                            replacing the single server there which was running out of
                            space.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-09-12</b><br/><br/>- Added separate report
                            types for reporting excessive updates and requesting gallery
                            splits/reversions.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-08-07</b><br/><br/>- Adjusted
                            the &quot;peak hours&quot; used by original image downloading to better
                            match the actual measured peak periods. It is now between 14:00 and
                            20:00 UTC Monday-Saturday, and between 05:00 and 20:00 UTC on Sundays.
                            <br/><br/><br/><b>2022-07-27</b><br/><br/>- Corrected an issue with the
                            image dispatch logic where it would not always avoid servers internally
                            flagged as offline.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-07-04</b><br/><br/>- Updated
                            the backend image fetch logic to make better use of the new topology,
                            especially if a server is offline for any reason.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-06-28</b><br/><br/>-
                            Three new (original) image servers are now live, one for expanding the
                            capacity at one location and two (re-)adding coverage to a different
                            location.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-06-07</b><br/><br/>A couple of minor
                            tweaks to the &quot;Download source image&quot; changes, since it
                            dropped the utilization by a lot more than we needed it to:<br/><br/>-
                            It no longer applies to galleries posted in the last <strike>7</strike>
                            30 days.<br/><br/>- It no longer applies for donators.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-06-06</b><br/><br/>-
                            Using the &quot;Download source image&quot; function will now consume GP
                            during peak hours. &quot;Peak hours&quot; for this purpose is (in UTC)
                            weekdays between 14:00 and 20:00, and weekends between Saturday 14:00
                            until Sunday 20:00. This will also be used outside of peak hours if the
                            image viewing limit is exhausted.<br/><br/>The GP cost is the same as
                            what it would be for resetting the image limit, and also the same as the
                            archiver cost for including it in an archive for a donator.<br/><br/>For
                            database health reasons, this function will consume 1000 GP at a time,
                            adding a &quot;hidden&quot; full image quota which is drawn from until
                            it is exhausted.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-06-05</b><br/><br/>- Added fields
                            to the API with the GID and key for a gallery&#39;s parent gallery (if
                            it has one), the first gallery in the chain (if it&#39;s different from
                            the queried gallery), and the current/active gallery in the chain (if it&#39;s
                            different from the queried gallery).<br/><br/>- The uploader name for
                            recently published disowned galleries is now also shown in <i>italic</i>
                            to better distinguish it from the &quot;visited link&quot;
                            color.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-05-11</b><br/><br/>- Minimum requirements
                            for new H@H clients were updated. They now need a throttle of 2000 KB/s
                            (up from 1000 KB/s) and a hourly bandwidth limit of 1000 MB (up from 300
                            MB). This is not retroactive.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-05-06</b><br/><br/>-
                            Fixed an issue with the Autotagger where if the master of a tag group
                            changed multiple times, and the former-master-current-slave tag was
                            upvoted by Autotagger itself, it wouldn&#39;t update the tags to reflect
                            the new master.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-04-28</b><br/><br/>- <a

                                    target="_blank">Added the &quot;Defaced&quot; expunge
                                type.</a><br/><br/>- Added expunge type filtering to the expunge
                            tracker along with some other minor filtering improvements.<br/><br/>-
                            When a tag is vetoed, the system will now only apply a tagging penalty
                            if the tag was recent, mimicking the behavior for normally downvoted
                            tags. (This prevents people from being penalized if the definition of a
                            tag changes.)<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-04-25</b><br/><br/>- Reclass tags
                            are now hidden from the tag pane if there is just one reclass tag with
                            positive tagging score and it matches the current category of the
                            gallery, unless you voted for or against
                            it.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-03-31</b><br/><br/>- Corrected an issue where
                            tags longer than 50 characters would not fully fit in an index table,
                            making them only partially searchable in some search modes.<br/><br/>-
                            Corrected an issue where the excluded uploader filter was not working
                            for (recently uploaded) disowned
                            galleries.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-02-24</b><br/><br/>- All the nodes of
                            the third and final web shard have been swapped over. This was the last
                            part of the site using older versions of the underlying
                            software.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-02-22</b><br/><br/>- All the nodes of
                            the second web shard have been swapped
                            over.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-02-10</b><br/><br/>- All the nodes of one of
                            the three main web shards have been swapped with new nodes that have
                            major version updates of pretty much everything. Let me know if you
                            notice any weirdness after
                            this.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-02-09</b><br/><br/>- Due to a software bug,
                            some combine (small) thumbnails would appear with negative colors under
                            some specific circumstances where the source images had a combination of
                            CMYK and grayscale colorspaces. A workaround for this was put in
                            place.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-02-06</b><br/><br/>- Added a second no-H@H
                            image loading mode named &quot;Legacy/HTTP&quot; for compatibility with
                            outdated browsers that do not have newer HTTPS certificate authorities
                            available. Since H@H only works over HTTPS, this has to use the site&#39;s
                            image servers, so like the old mode (now labeled &quot;Modern/HTTPS&quot;),
                            this is (bronze) donator only. This mode may or may not work in modern
                            browsers depending on type and security anality settings.<br/><br/>-
                            Cleaned up all the remaining dependencies on the old file metadata
                            structure. Everything now uses the new structure
                            exclusively.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-02-05</b><br/><br/>- The &quot;Hentai@Home
                            Local Network Host&quot; setting which was disabled some time ago due to
                            HTTPS complications has now been fully removed, since upcoming browser
                            changes means it won&#39;t be
                            reintroduced.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-02-04</b><br/><br/>- The uploader
                            and main bits of the site were switched over to the new file metadata
                            backend.<br/><br/>- The H@H backend was switched over to the new file
                            metadata backend. This also removes the last instance of legacy image
                            server handling.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-02-01</b><br/><br/>- Archivers
                            were switched over to the new file metadata backend. Let me know if you
                            spot any issues with recently generated archives.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-01-30</b><br/><br/>-
                            As part of a larger backend rework of how file metadata is stored, the
                            system has now been switched over to a new and more efficient way to
                            track blacklisted files. Let me know if you encounter any issues with
                            uploading after this.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-01-23</b><br/><br/>- The
                            per-user archive cost factor now only counts and applies to recreated
                            archives (i.e. not posted or downloaded in the last 30 days), but the
                            scaling factor was increased and now starts at x2. In other words,
                            archives for galleries published in the last 30 days or that were
                            downloaded in the last 30 days now always use the base cost regardless
                            of volume.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-01-19</b><br/><br/>- The minimum power
                            requirement for restricted tags was increased from 12 to 15.<br/><br/>-
                            Tags that have a stated comment requirement now actually check that you
                            made a comment.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-01-08</b><br/><br/>- Applied a
                            minor change to prevent some subtle brightening of resizes for some
                            files. Let me know if you spot any issues with new galleries after this.<br/><br/>-
                            Cycled the site&#39;s crypto wallets. This means that addresses
                            generated before 2021-01-23 will no longer be automatically credited; if
                            you do accidentally reuse an old address, send me a PM and I&#39;ll add
                            it manually. (The address that shows on the donation screen is always
                            current.)<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-12-25</b><br/><br/>- Entering a gallery
                            with a content warning should no longer &quot;consume&quot;
                            events/REs.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-12-15</b><br/><br/>- Various
                            consistency improvements for disowned gallery behavior:<br/>--
                            Disowned-but-recently-published galleries are again searchable by
                            uploader.<br/>-- The API now also returns the uploader&#39;s name for
                            disowned-but-recently-published galleries.<br/>-- The uploader readout
                            for disowned-but-recently-published galleries on the search and gallery
                            page now shows as faded to indicate that it was disowned.<br/><br/>(Note
                            that uploader exclusion searches do not work on neither disowned nor
                            disowned-but-recently-published galleries in the current implementation
                            since it would leak information. This will be changed in the future so
                            that disowned-but-recently-published galleries are also
                            hidden.)<br/><br/>- Added an &quot;uploaduid&quot; search option which
                            works just like &quot;uploader&quot; except it accepts a numeric user id
                            instead of the user&#39;s display
                            name.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-12-08</b><br/><br/>- To create a new
                            temporary tag (25+ MP only) you now have to explicitly use &quot;temp:tagname&quot;.<br/><br/>-
                            Inline creation of namespaced tags was disabled. People with namespacing
                            access must now use the dedicated tool for this.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-12-05</b><br/><br/>-
                            Added an additional confirmation for mass-deleting
                            favorites.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-12-03</b><br/><br/>- Tags on the &quot;My
                            Tags&quot; page are now clickable.<br/><br/>- Removed the checkbox for
                            the &quot;Between x and y pages&quot; search option since it was
                            entirely redundant.<br/><br/>- Removed the option to search torrent
                            filenames from the regular gallery search, since it has been broken for
                            versioned galleries for a long time, and fixing it was too much of a
                            performance loss. You can still search torrent filenames from the
                            torrent screen.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-11-29</b><br/><br/>- As part of an
                            internal reword of tagging statistics, the mod power formula has been
                            changed. It now looks at started and voted accuracy separately, and for
                            each, gives +0.56 per percentage point over 90% accuracy and subtracts
                            0.5 per percentage point below 85% accuracy, with a total cap of
                            (started / 1000 + voted /
                            10000).<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-11-28</b><br/><br/>- Language tags for a
                            language specified in the gallery uploader will now be set as the
                            uploader themselves with 100 power rather than as &quot;Autotagger&quot;.
                            This means the uploader can now withdraw these tags, and may also be
                            penalized if they are (intentionally) set wrong.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-11-21</b><br/><br/>-
                            Finished migrating the tracking table for older resampled files to use a
                            more efficient format. This is mostly used by the uploader and file
                            search.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-11-14</b><br/><br/>- Fixed a regression in
                            the tagging logic where galleries might end up as &quot;Other&quot; when
                            no strong language tags are present.<br/><br/>- If there are no strong
                            language tags on a gallery, the language will now be set back to &quot;Japanese&quot;.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-11-11</b><br/><br/>-
                            Fixed disowned galleries not showing the uploader name on the
                            search/index screen for galleries posted in the last 7 days.<br/><br/>-
                            Fixed disowning letting you rate your own galleries.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-11-10</b><br/><br/>-
                            Tagged minor languages will now register as &quot;Other&quot; rather
                            than &quot;Japanese&quot; even if they aren&#39;t explicitly registered
                            in the system.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-11-07</b><br/><br/>- After a
                            long-term revamp of the uploader and thumbnail publishing backend, the
                            one-hour &quot;Asia delay&quot; for new galleries has now been removed.

                            underlying software stack, so let me know if you encounter any
                            issues.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-02-01</b><br/><br/>- The H@H C&amp;C
                            service has been migrated to new servers. This affects everything
                            involving H@H clients. Note that the old servers will be running in
                            parallel with the new ones for a while, until all clients have switched
                            over to the new ones. (This happens automatically.)<br/><br/>Edit:
                            Corrected an issue where the H@H Downloader wasn&#39;t working for
                            non-cached galleries due to a missing library.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-01-31</b><br/><br/>-
                            The janitor services were migrated to new servers. This affects stuff
                            like stats gathering, index updates and various other background
                            tasks.<br/><br/>- Fixed broken expunge link on the gallery manager
                            screen.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-01-29</b><br/><br/>- The &quot;repo&quot;
                            service has been migrated to new servers. This affects torrent and
                            bounty upload/posting functionality, as well as bounty images and
                            torrent downloads.<br/><br/>- Corrected an issue where expunge voting
                            was not always restricted to users with a mod power of at least
                            2.<br/><br/>- Corrected an issue where some API calls that modify data
                            were not fully disabled when in read-only mode. (Though they would fail
                            due to a lack of write
                            access.)<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-01-27</b><br/><br/>- The EH thumbnail
                            servers now support HTTP/2.<br/><br/>- XML (most notably RSS) was
                            migrated to new servers.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-01-23</b><br/><br/>- BTC
                            and BCH wallets have been cycled. If you previously chose to use legacy
                            P2SH-style addresses for BTC, you have to do this again if you still
                            need those. Note that older wallet addresses will still be monitored for
                            at least six months.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-01-22</b><br/><br/>- Some
                            removed galleries were still listed on the uploader page, this should no
                            longer be the case.<br/><br/><br/><b>2021-01-12</b><br/><br/>- The
                            bitcoin nodes (both BTC and BCH) have been switched over to new servers.
                            As part of this, wallet addresses created before May 2020 are no longer
                            monitored, so if you accidentally reuse them, you will have to contact
                            me. (The wallet address displayed on the donation page will always be
                            current and valid.)

                                Fix</b><br/><br/>- Fixed an issue where some more characters in
                                uploader usernames were not properly searchable.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-21
                                    - Improvements</b><br/><br/>- Added some significant
                                optimizations for a frequently used search strategy for when
                                multiple name+tag/comment search terms are used and at least one of
                                the name+tag terms has less than 10000 hits. (For some cases this
                                will reduce processing time by &gt;90%).<br/><br/>- The search query
                                parser will now handle various cases where repeated or redundant
                                search qualifiers are used, such as weak:tag:foo or tag:tag:tag:bar.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-18
                                    - Fixes</b><br/><br/>- The publish date adjustment for galleries
                                created with the old uploaders (predating October 2021) has been
                                completed. This should fix the remaining quirkiness with gallery
                                sort placement as well as with the seek/jump mechanism. Note that
                                these galleries are now considered &quot;published&quot; when the
                                gallery was created rather than when it was actually published,
                                though in most cases this would only shift the date by a few minutes
                                to a few hours.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-17 - Minor
                                    Fixes</b><br/><br/>- When searching for comments, if the search
                                term was too short after being stripped of non-indexable characters,
                                the term was silently ignored. It now properly fails the search with
                                an error message instead.<br/><br/>- Fixed tags hidden under My Tags
                                not being displayed with search results when filters are
                                disabled.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-16 - Deployment +
                                    Fixes</b><br/><br/>- This update is now fully
                                deployed.<br/><br/>- Fixed an issue with how some dynamic stats were
                                generated that only manifested under high load.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-15
                                    - Minor Fixes</b><br/><br/>- Fixed a bug in favorite searching
                                where, depending on internal state and order of operation,
                                title-only searches could break when multiple terms were
                                used.<br/><br/>- The wording of &quot;default filters&quot; was
                                changed to &quot;custom filters&quot; to make it clearer that it is
                                referring to your personalized/customized tag, uploader and language
                                filters, rather than some global default filter.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-13
                                    - Minor Fixes</b><br/><br/>- Fixed some more search issues with
                                uploader usernames with leading or trailing underscores as well as
                                multiple consecutive spaces/underscores.<br/><br/>- We now avoid
                                using the /uploader/ shorthand URLs for uploader usernames
                                containing forward slashes since the resulting URLs are broken.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-11
                                    - Minor Additions/Tweaks</b><br/><br/>- When searching for tags
                                (or titles+tags) where there is just one tag match and you have that
                                tag filtered, the system will now specifically ignore that filter.
                                If you actually want the tag filtered, you can use the title:
                                qualifier.<br/><br/>- The search engine will now stop looking for
                                more results for a page if more than 1000 galleries have been
                                filtered. (This is mostly relevant in edge cases where you are
                                intentionally searching for things you heavily filtered.)<br/><br/>-
                                Fixed search warnings not being displayed for favorite
                                searches.<br/><br/>- Added a setting to remove the &quot;Your
                                default filters removed XX galleries from this page&quot;
                                message.<br/><br/>- Added a new qualifier &quot;weak:&quot; to
                                search for weak tags. This replaces the &quot;Search Low-Power Tags&quot;
                                checkbox. Using weak: in front of a keyword works the same as using
                                tag: except it will search weak tags (&lt;10 power) instead of
                                active (10+) ones.<br/><br/>This change allows for some additional
                                flexibility, since you can now search for various combinations of
                                weak tags and active tags - for example, all galleries with an
                                active parody tag from a particular series, and weak character tags
                                from said series.<br/><br/>Weak tags cannot be used for exclusions
                                or searched in favorites. Additionally, if you are using OR
                                searches, either all or none of the OR terms must use the weak:
                                qualifier.<br/><br/>It is not possible to search for both active and
                                weak instances of the same tag at the same time, or mix normal and
                                weak OR terms in general, since they use different indexes. These
                                are not artificial limitations. The weak tag search is there to aid
                                in tagging and cleanup in order to either get rid of them or make
                                them into active tags, not to get &quot;more results&quot; in casual
                                browsing.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-07 - Bugfixes</b> <br/><br/>-
                                Corrected an issue with tag/name searching in uploader results.<br/><br/>-
                                Corrected glitchy behavior with the new jump/seek selector on the
                                favorite page, as well as an issue with the favorite checkbox
                                selector positioning.<br/><br/>- Corrected seek/jump offsets not
                                being kept if you switched display mode (minimal/compact/etc) right
                                after using it.<br/><br/>- Corrected an issue where some characters
                                weren&#39;t properly stripped for name index lookups.<br/><br/>-
                                Corrected an issue where, when encountering terms that were long
                                enough to search but that contained characters that are not valid in
                                tags, it would still attempt to parse it as a tag except with those
                                characters stripped, but if there were less than 3 stripped
                                characters, it would then fail the term as being too short. Terms
                                with characters that cannot be used in tags are now instead parsed
                                as title-only unless a different qualifier is

                                arbitrary jumps (number of days/weeks/months/years) backwards and
                                forwards in search results, as well as arbitrary seeks to a specific

                                appears.<br/><br/>Entering a number will make it jump backwards or

                                somewhat different than &lt; Next/Jump and Next/Jump &gt; -
                                specifically, which button you use determines whether it uses the
                                date as the starting point or the ending point.<br/><br/>You can
                                also use the YYYY-MM shorthand date. In this case, it will start
                                from the first day in the month when going backwards and the last
                                day in the month when going forward. (In other words, in either case
                                it will include that entire month.)<br/><br/>If you only enter a
                                number (not followed by d w m or y) and it is between 2007 and 2099,
                                it will be interpreted as a year. In this case, it will seek to the
                                last day the year when going forwards and the first day of the year
                                when going forwards.<br/><br/>With the YYYY-MM-DD and YYYY-MM
                                formats, the two first Ys can be left out - in other words, 22-11-05
                                will be interpreted as 2022-11-05.<br/><br/><strike>Seeks and Jumps
                                    to galleries posted before October 2021 or so will be wonky
                                    until I run a script to make some fixes to the publish
                                    timestamps to match the behavior of newer galleries. This
                                    correction will happen shorty after the update is fully
                                    deployed.</strike><br/><br/><br/><b>Bugfixes</b><br/><br/>-
                                Corrected an issue where galleries were no longer displayed under
                                favorites if they are unavailable.<br/><br/>- Corrected an issue
                                where, when using the /tag/ URLs (such as when clicking tags from
                                the gallery page), it would keep adding additional quotes if you
                                clicked the navigation links.<br/><br/>- Corrected some issues with
                                uploader usernames with underscores and spaces. Note that for syntax
                                and visual ambiguity reasons, underscores and spaces are now
                                considered equivalent in uploader username searches.<br/><br/>-
                                Corrected excluded categories still appearing on the Popular Pane.
                                (They are still supposed to appear with file, gid and favorite
                                searches.)<br/><br/>- Corrected a potential issue where the file/gid
                                searches weren&#39;t including expunged galleries even though they
                                were supposed to.<br/><br/>- Corrected an issue with dashes/hyphens
                                in name searches where they weren&#39;t properly stripped for the
                                index lookup.<br/><br/>- Corrected an issue where if you were using
                                advanced search and *only* picked a minimum rating, the navigation
                                wouldn&#39;t include it, so it would reset between
                                pages.<br/><br/><br/><b>2022-11-01 - Original Post</b><br/><br/>This
                                update is a complete rewrite of the gallery search engine, meaning
                                that the usage and behavior of searches has changed in a number of
                                more or less significant ways.<br/><br/>The most significant and
                                visible fundamental change is that the internal segmenting of search
                                results is now done by gallery ID (GID) ranges rather than &quot;pages&quot;.
                                While this means jumping to an arbitrary &quot;page&quot; in the
                                result is no longer supported, this is arguably an improvement since
                                you can now jump to an arbitrary GID instead. This also means each
                                page of results will be fixed on the same set of galleries even if
                                it is refreshed after new galleries are added. The page navigation
                                has been reworked to reflect this.<br/><br/>This also fundamentally
                                fixes a long-standing issue where going backwards in the results via
                                the page navigation (as opposed to the browser back button) would
                                often include results from the following page if you were using any
                                form of filtering.<br/><br/>Overall, these changes allow for massive
                                performance improvements (three orders of magnitude in some common
                                cases) as well as significant new functionality (keep reading), and
                                there are no longer any limits to how large a search result can be.
                                Search terms that were previously capped to 100,000 results (like
                                say &quot;big breasts&quot; which is tagged on 350K+ galleries) can
                                now be browsed in their entirety. <br/><br/><br/><b>OR Tag
                                    Searching</b><br/><br/>OR searching is now supported for tags.
                                (Probably the most requested feature of all time.)<br/><br/>To use
                                OR tag searching, prefix the keyword with ~<br/><br/>Example: ~yuri
                                ~&quot;females only&quot; ~f:sole_female&#036;<br/><br/>Specifically,
                                if you have at least two keywords with the OR operator, the search
                                will return all galleries that contain at least one of the tags in
                                question. Using the OR operator will imply the tag: qualifier. If
                                you use it with any other qualifier that isn&#39;t a tag namespace,
                                the OR operator is ignored and the keyword will run as a standard
                                AND search.<br/><br/>Using OR searching will &quot;consume&quot; one
                                of the allowed inclusion search terms. If you only specify one OR
                                term, it will be treated as an AND tag-only term. There are no
                                specific limits to how many OR terms you can specify, though it will
                                still be practically limited by the search string length cap. It
                                will additionally bail if the overall OR search is matching more
                                than 1000 tags internally, so consider using exact tags to allow for
                                more terms.<br/><br/>Wildcards cannot be used for OR
                                terms.<br/><br/><br/><b>Exclude-Only Searching</b><br/><br/>You can
                                now do exclude-only searches. (Probably the other most requested
                                feature of all time.)<br/><br/>Example: -yaoi -m:footjob -&quot;glory
                                hole&quot; -sole_male&#036; -title:&quot;novel ai&quot;
                                -comment:pixiv -uploader:BigDickDave69<br/><br/>You can use up to 10
                                comment+favnote exclusion terms and 10 tag (or hybrid tag+name)
                                exclusion terms in a search.<br/><br/>The gid, uploader, uploaduid
                                and title qualifiers are not specifically limited for exclusions,
                                though they will still be practically limited by the search string
                                length cap.<br/><br/><br/><b>Tag Watching</b><br/><br/>The time
                                cutoff for the tag watching page has been significantly
                                increased:<br/><br/>- For non-donators, the cutoff was increased
                                from one week to at least one month. The exact cutoff depends on
                                internal segmenting, the rate new galleries are added, and the total
                                index count for your watched tags. It will generally be somewhere
                                between one and six months.<br/><br/>- For donators (gold star+),
                                there are no longer any cutoffs. In other words, you can browse and
                                search watched tags back to the launch of the site if you want. Note
                                however that searching for terms that have few matches in your
                                watched tags may produce fewer than expected results per
                                page.<br/><br/><br/><b>UI =&gt; Search Syntax Changes</b><br/><br/>The
                                &quot;Search Gallery Name&quot;, &quot;Search Gallery Tags&quot; and
                                &quot;Search Gallery Description&quot; checkboxes as well as the
                                corresponding search checkboxes on the Favorite page have all been
                                removed; this functionality is now part of the search syntax
                                instead.<br/><br/>By default, each search term will be interpreted
                                as a hybrid tag+title search, and will match the gallery name (both
                                english/romaji and japanese) as well as the gallery tags.<br/><br/>To
                                only match gallery names, prefix the term with the title:
                                qualifier<br/>* Example: title:keyword -title:&quot;string of
                                keywords&quot;<br/><br/>To only match gallery tags, prefix the term
                                with a tag namespace, or tag: for all namespaces, or use the exact
                                tag operator &#036;, or use the OR operator ~<br/>* Example: f:&quot;big
                                breasts&quot; tag:group -futanari&#036; ~twintails<br/><br/>To
                                search uploader gallery comments, prefix the term with the comment:
                                qualifier<br/>* Example: comment:&quot;insightful uploader musings&quot;
                                -comment:&quot;less insightful ones&quot;<br/><br/>Favorite searches
                                only: To search favorite notes, prefix the term with the favnote:
                                qualifier<br/>* Example: favnote:&quot;this is my favorite gallery&quot;
                                -favnote:&quot;on the citadel&quot;<br/><br/>Note that this means
                                combined tag+name+comment/favnote search terms are no longer
                                supported.<br/><br/><br/><b>Search Parsing Changes</b><br/><br/>-
                                When doing unquoted searches with unqualified short and/or
                                non-indexable words (a, an, ai, to, the, and, so, on, and so on), as
                                well as some common adjectives (small, big, huge, gigantic), they
                                will now be automatically appended or combined with the following
                                priority:<br/><br/>* If there is a non-qualified search term
                                immediately following the short word, it will be combined with that
                                one.<br/><br/>For example, searching for &quot;a dick in a box&quot;
                                without quotes will be searched as &quot;a dick&quot; &quot;in a box&quot;.
                                Everyone&#39;s new favorite &quot;ai generated&quot; without quotes
                                will be searched as if it had quotes.<br/><br/>* If there is a
                                non-qualified search term immediately preceding the short word, it
                                will be combined with that one.<br/><br/>For example, searching for
                                &quot;novel ai&quot; without quotes will be searched as if it had
                                quotes.<br/><br/>* If there are only short words, they will be
                                combined into one quoted word if there is more than one.<br/><br/>For
                                example, searching for &quot;ex on the ox&quot; without quotes will
                                be searched as if it had quotes. <br/><br/>* If there is just one
                                short word, or the short words are between qualified search terms,
                                it will be searched as an exact tag. A warning is printed in this
                                case.<br/><br/>For example, searching for &quot;9s artist:a 2b&quot;
                                without quotes will be searched as &quot;tag:9s&#036;&quot; &quot;artist:a&#036;&quot;
                                &quot;tag:2b&#036;&quot;<br/><br/>To combine short words with a
                                different priority, use quotes or underscores. (&quot;word1 word2
                                word3&quot; and word1_word2_word3 are equivalent.)<br/><br/>Note
                                that there is a single two-character word &quot;3d&quot; that was
                                specifically whitelisted for title searches, but it is not an
                                indexable word for comment searches so it cannot be used for
                                that.<br/><br/>- Support for single-character wildcarding was
                                dropped, and the * wildcard can now only be used at the end of
                                keywords. Title, comment and favnote searches are implicitly
                                wildcarded for indexing reasons, so adding a wildcard will only
                                affect tag searching.<br/><br/><br/><b>Search Term
                                    Limits</b><br/><br/>Exclusions and inclusions now have separate
                                limits. A query can have up to 5 name+tag inclusion terms, 10
                                name+tag exclusion terms, and 10 comment+favnote inclusion+exclusion
                                terms.<br/><br/>For both inclusions and exclusions, uploader:,
                                uploadid: and gid: terms aren&#39;t specifically limited, but would
                                still be limited by the max length of the search string (200 chars).<br/><br/>For
                                exclusions, title: terms are also not limited.<br/><br/><br/><b>GID
                                    Searching</b><br/><br/>You can now use the gid: search qualifier
                                to search (publicly visible) galleries by Gallery ID. If you search
                                a GID that has been replaced, it will list the current gallery
                                instead.<br/><br/>Inclusion gid: terms cannot be combined with
                                keyword searches or used in watch mode. This does not apply to
                                exclusion terms. If used for exclusion, it will not exclude any
                                galleries that replaced the provided GID.<br/><br/>You can specify
                                multiple gid: terms in the same query for an implicit OR
                                search.<br/><br/>This search mode will show both normal and expunged
                                galleries. Default tag, language and uploader filters are
                                automatically disabled for these searches.<br/><br/><br/><b>Result
                                    Counting</b><br/><br/>For performance reasons, the search engine
                                will no longer count the exact number of results in large result
                                sets; instead result counts will usually be approximated based on
                                various metrics. It will say &quot;about&quot; if the count is an
                                estimate.<br/><br/>For complex multi-term searches with large result
                                sets, it may not have enough information to give a reasonable
                                estimate. In these cases, rather than showing a potentially wildly
                                inaccurate one, it will just show &quot;many&quot;. This only
                                affects the count readout, navigation for these search results works
                                the same as for smaller ones.<br/><br/>Smaller result sets (i.e.
                                those that fit on one page) should return the exact count in all
                                cases. Filtered galleries are included in this count, to match the
                                behavior for estimates.<br/><br/>The page range filter, exclusion
                                search terms and default language/uploader/tag filters will not
                                generally be reflected in approximate result count
                                estimates.<br/><br/>If you use the category, rating or torrent
                                filters, it will use precomputed adjustment factors to correct the
                                estimate. For some searches this estimate may be fairly inaccurate,
                                say if you search for terms that are mostly applicable for specific
                                categories then unselect other categories.<br/><br/>Result counts
                                are not displayed in favorite searches or on the popular page. In
                                the former case, it would only be able to display one for small
                                result sets, and in the latter, it&#39;s all one page of results
                                anyway. You can however still see the total for each favorite
                                category.<br/><br/><br/><b>Tag Search Behavior</b><br/><br/>- Tag
                                searching now defaults to matching on word boundaries to reduce
                                unwanted matches. In other words, searching for &quot;tag:mana&quot;
                                will still match all tags that have &quot;mana&quot; as one of the
                                words (like &quot;secret of mana&quot; [=&gt; seiken densetsu] or
                                &quot;mana inuyama&quot;), but it does not match &quot;manabe&quot;,
                                &quot;manatsu&quot;, &quot;manami&quot; and so on. Searching for
                                &quot;tag:mana*&quot; will restore the previous behavior.<br/><br/>-
                                If there are too many tag matches for a term, it will now
                                automatically rerun the term as an exact search instead of erroring
                                out.<br/><br/>- Selecting &quot;Search Low-Power Tags&quot; will now
                                only search low-power tags. This mode will also not do hybrid
                                title/tag searches, so if a term is left unqualified (i.e. &quot;big
                                breasts&quot;) it will only search the tag. You can still search
                                titles by using the title: qualifier.<br/><br/>- The &quot;Search
                                Downvoted Tags&quot; option was removed.<br/><br/><br/><b>Comment
                                    Search Behavior</b><br/><br/>Uploader comments and favorite
                                notes are now searched using the comment: and favnote: qualifiers.
                                favnote: is only available in favorite searches.<br/><br/>The way
                                comments are indexed have been fundamentally changed, and there will
                                be some subtle differences between normal text searches and favorite
                                + exclusion-only text searches, since the former will usually use
                                indexes while the latter do not. <br/><br/>Most notably, some
                                otherwise-searchable common words (like &quot;this&quot; and &quot;with&quot;)
                                are not comment-searchable when the index is used but will be
                                searchable when it is not. Also, when the index is used, words
                                starting with these short words will not be matched unless you
                                search for that exactly (like &quot;with&quot; and &quot;withhold&quot;).<br/><br/>Furthermore,
                                when the index is used it will only find word matches that start
                                with the string, but when it&#39;s not it will also find matches
                                that have the string as part of a word.<br/><br/>The index is only
                                used for normal inclusion comment searches, but even for those it
                                may not be used for some words and searches depending on various
                                internal factors and thresholds, so you should not rely on this
                                behavior.<br/><br/><br/><b>Other Changes</b><br/><br/>- Various
                                issues and limitations with favorite searches have been resolved.
                                Searches in favorites should now behave the same as normal searches
                                except for the noted comment/favnote search behavior.<br/><br/>-
                                Exclusion searches for titles, tags (except for exact tags),
                                comments and favnotes will now match any part of a word; i.e. -&quot;laughter&quot;
                                will exclude &quot;slaughter&quot;.<br/><br/>- Indexes are now
                                generally updated immediately when the underlying data changes,
                                which should reduce the delay until changes are reflected in
                                searches. (Due to caching, there can still be some delay.)<br/><br/>-
                                Whenever a gallery title has a mixed string of unicode and latin
                                characters without any spaces or other breakable characters, like
                                romaji漢字moreromaji, it would previously only be searchable with
                                terms starting with &quot;rom...&quot;, &quot;漢字...&quot; and &quot;字mo..&quot;.
                                It is now also searchable for &quot;mor...&quot;.<br/><br/>- The
                                &quot;Your default filters removed...&quot; message is now more
                                consistent and specifically counts all galleries filtered by your
                                default uploader, tag and language search filter settings. (When
                                using both filters and exclusions and a gallery would have been
                                removed by both, it is counted as an exclusion.)<br/><br/>-
                                Selecting &quot;Search Expunged Galleries&quot; will now only search
                                expunged galleries in normal searches. (File searches, GID searches
                                and favorite searches will always display both normal and expunged
                                galleries.)<br/><br/>- File searches can no longer be combined with
                                keyword searches or other filters. This search mode will show both
                                normal and expunged galleries. Default tag, language and uploader
                                filters are now automatically disabled for these searches.<br/><br/>-
                                Excessively narrow page range filters (min &gt; 1000, max &lt; 10,
                                min/max &gt; 0.8, min-max &lt; 20) are no longer allowed.<br/><br/>-
                                The max number of results per page is now 100. Paging Enlargement

                                    Issues/Quirks/Complaints/Workingasintendedisms</b><br/><br/>-
                                <strike>You may sometimes see galleries appear out-of-order when
                                    going from one page to the next - in other words, going by the
                                    posted date, you would have expected the gallery to be on
                                    another page. This mostly applies to older galleries that
                                    predated the latest uploader update. This is because, prior to
                                    said update, a gallery could have been assigned a GID long
                                    before it was actually posted. This might eventually be
                                    addressed after a future redesign of the gallery metadata tables
                                    by renumbering galleries that are significantly out of
                                    order.</strike><br/><br/>- If you are browsing from the end of a
                                search results (backwards browsing mode) all the way to the start,
                                the &quot;last&quot; page in the result (the one with the oldest
                                results) will have a full page of results and the &quot;first&quot;
                                page in the result (with the most recent ones) will have the
                                remainder. This is working as intended.<br/><br/>- If you go
                                backwards in a search result and get to the &quot;first&quot; page
                                (with the most recent results), the &quot;&lt;&lt; First&quot; link
                                will be lit up to flip back to the first page in forwards browsing
                                mode even if there are no further pages and &quot;&lt; Prev&quot; is
                                disabled. This is working as intended.<br/><br/>- If you search for
                                several AND inclusion tag terms (or hybrid title+tag terms), where
                                every term has many results (~10K+) and some have a lot of results
                                (~100K+), and there is a low degree of overlap between the tags, you
                                may see fewer than expected results per page. You can usually use
                                exact tags to avoid this.<br/><br/>- In general, &quot;results per
                                page&quot; should be considered a target rather than a guarantee.
                                For example, as an internal optimization, if a result page is at
                                least 95% full after a search cycle, it may return with a couple of
                                results &quot;missing&quot; instead of starting another search cycle
                                (which can be expensive). This does not mean it&#39;s withholding
                                results from you, you&#39;ll find them on the next page.<br/><br/>-
                                &quot;But &#036;tool/&#036;script needs the ability to access
                                arbitrary pages in search results and/or accurate search result
                                counts&quot; is out of scope/wontfix. Update it to use the new
                                gid-based navigation. And no, the old search engine was not &quot;working
                                just fine the way it was&quot;, it was failing on an ever-increasing
                                number of searches due to running out of RAM when building results
                                and badly needed a fundamental redesign to cope with the
                                ever-increasing size of the index.<br/><br/><br/>This is likely the
                                most complicated update in the site&#39;s history, so there will
                                probably be bugs and other subtle behavioral changes. Please don&#39;t
                                hestiate to ask whether something is intentional if it&#39;s not
                                noted in these patch notes.

                            <div class="newstext">After some internal discussion followed by a
                                public debate, we have gone ahead and added a new expunge reason
                                named &quot;Defaced&quot; with the following description:<br/><br/>&quot;Content
                                has been defaced by adding content-obstructing scanmarks, censorship
                                or advertisements beyond what is present in the original artist
                                release, or has been intentionally degraded to the point where
                                legibility is an issue.&quot;<br/><br/>Since this expunge type has a
                                subjective element, you need a mod power of at least 20 to start
                                this type of expunge petition. It won&#39;t show in the list if you
                                have less.<br/><br/>&quot;Degraded&quot; includes any sort of
                                intentional bad-faith sabotage of the core content, including but
                                not limited to excessive downsampling, blurring, pixelation etc, as
                                well as leaving out core content.<br/><br/>Scanmarks that do not
                                obstruct content or promotional pages added after the content pages
                                do not qualify.<br/><br/>Older low-resolution scans are exempt.<br/><br/>This
                                expunge type does not contribute towards the automatic temporary
                                upload ban.<br/><br/>Expunge type filtering was also added to the
                                expunge tracker as part of this addition, along with some other
                                minor filtering improvements.

                            <div class="newsdate">Posted Wednesday, 1st of December 2021, 09:56
                                UTC

                            <div class="newstext">For various reasons, primarily to help prevent
                                some issues with searching in the &quot;misc&quot; namespace, we
                                decided to make some changes to the tag namespacing. Essentially,
                                this involves making new namespaces for all &quot;approved&quot;
                                tags. The &quot;misc&quot; namespace has been renamed to &quot;temp&quot;
                                to emphasize that it is only used for &quot;unapproved&quot; or
                                temporary tags.<br/><br/>The new namespaces are as
                                follows:<br/><br/><b><u>mixed (x)</u></b>: holds mixed-gender fetish
                                tags<br/>- e.g. group, mmf threesome, ffm threesome, body swap,
                                multiple assjob<br/>⠀<br/><b><u>other (o)</u></b>: holds approved
                                technical tags<br/>- e.g. compilation, novel, mosaic censorship, 3d,
                                animated, full color, multi-work series<br/>⠀<br/><b><u>cosplayer
                                    (cos)</u></b>: holds existing and future cosplayer tags<br/>- If
                                the cosplayer consistently uses a name order, use that. Otherwise,
                                follow the name order of the cosplayer&#39;s country.<br/>⠀<br/>While
                                the &quot;temp&quot; namespace is for all intents and purposes
                                identical to the old &quot;misc&quot; namespace, in the future there
                                may be some changes to the search mechanics for this namespace, as
                                well as a more aggressive pruning mechanism whenever all the current
                                tags have been migrated to the &quot;approved&quot; namespaces. We
                                will get back to that at a later date.<br/><br/>Note that you may
                                see some inconsistencies in the tag pane due to caching whenever a
                                tag is moved. That should automatically fix itself when the cache
                                expires or any tag is added or voted on.<br/><br/>Let me know if you
                                encounter any issues that AREN&#39;T &quot;(tag) still shows up as
                                as (old namespace) on (gallery)&quot;.

                                    gallery during the beta, don&#39;t try to &quot;fix&quot; it,
                                    leave it and let me know so I can figure out what went
                                    wrong.</b></strike><br/><br/><strike>The new uploaders are now
                                    used for new uploads and new versions of existing galleries.
                                    Existing galleries will be migrated soon.</strike><br/><br/>The
                                new uploaders are now used for all uploads, and all existing
                                unpublished uploads have been migrated.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>New
                                uploader servers have now been deployed, which will eventually
                                replace the current uploaders that were deployed six years ago.
                                These new servers also come with a new major release of the uploader
                                interface. While they have been in closed beta testing for the last
                                week or so, I decided to run a public beta as well before switching
                                to the new servers entirely.<br/><br/>The new servers run new major
                                versions of pretty much everything, the internals of the uploader
                                have been significantly reworked, and it also uses the new core
                                library that was first added to the previous version of HV, so
                                please be on the lookout for any issues.<br/><br/>Uploads may
                                temporarily be somewhat slower than before, since files have to also
                                sync over to the old uploaders for this initial release. When the
                                old uploaders have been phased out, this will go back to
                                normal.<br/><br/>Unpublished galleries that were added on the old
                                uploaders will not show up on the new ones until they have been
                                imported, which will happen some time after the new uploaders go
                                fully live. The old uploaders will be available until
                                then.<br/><br/>Similarly, galleries added or versioned (cloned) on
                                the new uploaders will not show up on the old ones, though there was
                                a check added to prevent a gallery from being versioned on both the
                                new and old uploaders.<br/><br/><br/><b>New Features</b><br/><br/>-
                                Added time-based auto-sorting that allows you to easily resort a
                                gallery to have newly added files first (or last) without having to
                                manually reorder them, which is a common task for updated image
                                galleries.<br/><br/>This uses the publish time for the gallery in
                                the chain each file first appears in, and is only applicable for
                                versioned (cloned) galleries. Note that the order the files were
                                uploaded in for a given gallery in the chain does not matter for
                                this sort as it goes by which gallery it was first added to, but you
                                can keep the current order within each set of files.<br/><br/>-
                                Added an &quot;auto-sort&quot; method called &quot;Remove Exact
                                Duplicates&quot; which, as the name implies, will remove duplicated
                                files from the gallery. The first file in the current page order
                                will be preserved.<br/><br/>The available methods are now:<br/>*
                                Remove exact duplicate files from the gallery<br/>* Sort based on
                                natural or lexical ordering of the filenames, ignoring when they
                                were added. (These are the old methods.)<br/>* Sort based on the
                                time a file was first added to a chain of galleries, using either a
                                Recent First (descending) or Recent Last (ascending) sort. It can
                                then either keep the current sort order within each set of files, or
                                do an additional natural or lexical sort based on the
                                filenames.<br/><br/><br/>- Added the option to &quot;disown&quot;
                                any published gallery. This will remove the gallery from the
                                uploader interface, remove the uploader link/readout from the
                                gallery, and prevent the gallery from being found with an uploader
                                search.<br/><br/>You will not be able to make (or request) changes
                                to a gallery after disowning it. You will however continue gaining
                                toplist points and GP from disowned galleries.<br/><br/>You cannot
                                disown a gallery before it has been fully published (&quot;Visible&quot;
                                changes from &quot;Soon&quot;). Recently published disowned
                                galleries will still show the uploader for a week after being
                                published.<br/><br/>Note that expunged galleries will now also be
                                &quot;disowned&quot; rather than &quot;deleted&quot;. &quot;Deleting&quot;
                                published galleries is never possible anymore. Unpublished galleries
                                will still be erased as before.<br/><br/><br/>- When creating a new
                                gallery, you can now set the initial language for the gallery
                                directly on the uploader screen. This will automatically create
                                Autotagger tags for that language on the gallery when it is
                                published.<br/><br/>For an already published or versioned (cloned)
                                gallery, it will still show the currently active language based on
                                the current tags, but you will not be able to change it from the
                                uploader interface.<br/><br/>Before anyone tries to argue whether a
                                language should be &quot;common&quot; or not, the selection list is
                                dynamically generated and is purely based on the number of galleries
                                using the tag for the language.<br/><br/>To prevent excessive
                                clutter, languages with less than 5 tagged galleries are not
                                included in the list. Any new language tags are automatically added
                                to the list when they reach 5 tagged galleries.<br/><br/>If the
                                category is set to &quot;Image Set&quot;, the language is ignored if
                                it is set to &quot;Speechless&quot; or &quot;Text Cleaned&quot;.
                                Similarly, if the category is set to &quot;Game CG&quot;, the
                                language is ignored if it is set to &quot;Speechless&quot;. Note
                                that it allows you to set it, it&#39;s just ignored when publishing.<br/><br/><br/>-
                                A new image previewer for unpublished galleries was added, primarily
                                because galleries now only &quot;exist&quot; in the uploader until
                                they are published. This will always use the 1280x resamples if
                                available for the image, originals otherwise.<br/><br/>While
                                previewing an image, you can use right arrow/numpad or D to go to
                                the next page, and left arrow/numpad or A for the previous page. You
                                can also close the image preview with spacebar. <br/><br/>Unlike the
                                preview on the old uploaders, this preview will immediately mirror
                                any file order changes or deletions, so you should be able to
                                quickly check the new page order before saving the
                                changes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Changes and Fixes</b><br/><br/>- The way
                                unpublished galleries are stored in the system was fundamentally
                                changed; among other things, this fixes a problem where galleries
                                that were created a long time before they were published would
                                &quot;bypass&quot; the Watched page.<br/><br/>- After publishing, a
                                gallery now have an explicit &quot;processing&quot; state while some
                                final background tasks take place, where they are fully functional
                                except that some thumbnail variants aren&#39;t generated yet. They
                                can be accessed (and tagged) if you have the link, but aren&#39;t
                                yet publicly listed.<br/><br/>- Thumbnails are now pushed to the
                                standard thumbnail servers immediately rather than as a scheduled
                                background job. The uploader thumbnail servers will be retired
                                together with the old uploaders, and the &quot;Asia delay&quot; will
                                be removed when this is done.<br/><br/>- Reworked some of the
                                mechanisms to prevent excessive expunge posters and new gallery
                                posters from spamming the system. Among other things, this check now
                                happens at publish time rather than gallery creation time.<br/><br/>-
                                You can now create a maximum of 250 upload folders. Note that if you
                                are one of the 18 people who currently have more than this, you
                                might want to consolidate folders manually, as any excess folders
                                may be dropped in a future update, setting those galleries as &quot;Unsorted&quot;.<br/><br/>-
                                You can now have a maximum of 1000 unpublished galleries.<br/><br/>-
                                Unpublished galleries will now be deleted 1 year after they were
                                last touched. Older unpublished galleries will have a moratorium of
                                1 year from the time they are imported to the new system.<br/><br/>-
                                Corrected an issue where restrictive/broken permissions for files in
                                ZIP archives could prevent files from being included. Note that
                                filenames in ZIP files still have to be unique across any
                                subdirectories, otherwise only one of the files with the same
                                filename will be included.<br/><br/>- Support for RAR archive files
                                has been dropped.<br/><br/><strike>- The same exact file can now
                                    only appear in a gallery once, mostly to prevent any lingering
                                    issues with accidentally starting multiple uploads at the same
                                    time. This is not retroactive to old published galleries, but if
                                    an old published gallery is cloned and when an old unpublished
                                    gallery is imported to the new system, any duplicate files will
                                    be removed.</strike><br/><br/>- The same exact file with the
                                same exact filename can now only appear in a gallery once, mostly to
                                prevent any lingering issues with accidentally starting multiple
                                uploads at the same time. This is not retroactive to old published
                                galleries, but if an old published gallery is versioned/cloned, any
                                duplicate files with the same exact filename will be removed; a
                                warning will be printed in this case. Old unpublished galleries will
                                also have any duplicated pages with identical file+name removed when
                                imported to the new system<br/><br/>- When trying to access a
                                replaced gallery in the uploader, it will now forward you to the
                                current (published or unpublished) version of the gallery.<br/><br/>-
                                The readout for &quot;Child Gallery&quot; on the manage screen was
                                never actually used since older versions of a gallery could never be
                                &quot;managed&quot;, and was removed.<br/><br/>- &quot;Standard Sort&quot;
                                was renamed &quot;Lexical Sort&quot; to be less ambiguous.<br/><br/>-
                                Galleries that are being updated/replaced are now still shown in the
                                uploader list until the replacement is published, and will have a
                                link to the replacement gallery.<br/><br/>- The category selector
                                was moved, and the &quot;make public&quot; checkbox was removed in
                                favor of a separate option in the selector drop-down.<br/><br/>-
                                Actions that are no longer available on a gallery (such as changing
                                the category or name on non-recently published galleries) are now
                                grayed out instead of just returning an error if you were to try to
                                change them.<br/><br/>- Other minor UI tweaks and fixes.

                                    page</a> that lets you override the country used to determine
                                which part of the H@H network to load images from.<br/><br/>Obviously,
                                this allows you to correct the country if it is wrong, but it also
                                allows for certain advanced behavior, like if you are browsing the
                                site itself through a VPN or proxy in a different country, but still
                                want to make use of H@H clients in your own
                                country/region.<br/><br/>There aren&#39;t any particular limitations
                                on the use of this feature, but you generally want to avoid
                                selecting the wrong country unless you have a good reason for it,
                                like if you&#39;re having issues with government censorship or
                                connectivity in general.
